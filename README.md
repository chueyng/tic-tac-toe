# GA Project #0 - Tic Tac Toe Game

### Overview

Let's start out with something fun - **a game!**

**We'll be making Tic Tac Toe**, a game that takes seconds to learn but minutes to master! Everyone will get a chance to **be creative**, and work through some really **tough programming challenges** to get your feet wet in the world of web development. 

> "hand me your phone," load up the game, and play a quick round!

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!

### What You've Learned

By the time you submit this project, you will have covered new ground in many of the big themes of the course:

- **Command Line**: Practice interacting with the computer and navigating the filesystem from the command line.
- **Source Control**: Manage and interact with a git repository to store changes to code.
- **Programming Fundamentals**: Work with objects, constructors, events, while learning how to strategically solve problems and resolve errors.
- **Web Fundamentals**:  Learn how communication happens over the internet, and how to structure, style, and animate documents within a browser. Also learn how to respond to actions your users take and the data they input into the browser.
- **Browser Applications**:  Dive into CSS, Sass, and how to use libraries and frameworks to get lots of style for free.
- **Deployment**: Host a static web site in a managed hosting environment.
- **Products and Teams**: Document your code and your code repository so others understand what you've built.

### Big Goals

* **Build a web application from scratch**, without a starter codebase
* Use your programming skills to **map out the game logic for a simple game like Tic Tac Toe**
* **Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files** in your application
* Build an application **to a spec that someone else gives you**
* **Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete**
* **Craft a ``readme.md`` file that explains your app** to the world

---

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Render a game board in the browser**
* **Switch turns** between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
* **Visually display which side won** if a player gets three in a row or show a draw/"catâ€™s game" if neither wins
* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
* Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
* Use **Javascript** for **DOM manipulation**
* **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

---

### Bonus

These are for extra credit! Don't focus on these until you've hit the core requirements.

* Keep track of **multiple game rounds** with a win counter
* **Get inventive with your styling**, e.g. use hover effects or animations to spiff things up
* **Use LocalStorage** to persist data locally to allow games to continue after page refresh or loss of internet connectivity
