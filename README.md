# GA Project #0 - Tic Tac Toe Game

### Overview

Basically, this is common Tic Tac Toe game that's my Project ZERO in GA. It's fun to build it especially it done by using jquery, html and css codings. 

My code structures are quite messy and should have way to simplify it. Argh, that's ways to go! 

I only feeling proud and happy that I could make local storage work out. Many thanks to Joel and Jack for guiding me through this.

Try my game and play it out.
